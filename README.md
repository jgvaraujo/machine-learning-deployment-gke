# Machine Learning model deployment pipeline in GKE using Cloud Endpoints (OpenAPI version)

_Jo√£o Araujo, May 08, 2020_ 

It's important to update your model as soon as you have new data coming to your organization. Create a pipeline to update this model is not so difficult when you have full access to your data, but deploy it is not so simple. We have lot's of possibilities to do it and in this project I'll show how to create a deployment pipeline in GKE using Google Cloud  Platform.

First, we need to bind a role to the Google Cloud Build service account as a Kubernetes Engine Developer. We can do this in point'n'click in the settings of Cloud Build or through terminal using [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) (local or in [cloud shell interface](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/)):

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format='get(projectNumber)')

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member "serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role "roles/container.developer"
```

You'll need to activate some Google Cloud APIs before go through this article. Again, you can do this in point'n'click or using the SDK:

```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
    containeranalysis.googleapis.com \
    servicemanagement.googleapis.com \
    servicecontrol.googleapis.com \
    endpoints.googleapis.com
```

To work with Kubernetes, be sure that you have `kubectl` installed in you machine. `kubectl`is a command line tool for controlling *Kubernetes* clusters. If you don't, please read the installation guide [[1]](#L1). I recommend you to install `kubectl`via [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).

## Toy problem & the model entity

In this article, I used the scikit-learn [Boston data set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-house-prices-dataset) to create my ML model. It is a regression of a continuous target variable, namely, price. To make it even simpler, I trained a [Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) model that also belongs to the scikit-learn package, but you could choose any other model (XGBoost, LightGBM, ...).

The folder named `train` contains a Python file, `boston_problem.py`, that loads the dataset, saves a JSON file (`example.json`) for test and saves the scikit-learn model object into a Pickle file (`ml-model.pkl`). Here is the most important part of the code: 

 ```python
X.sample(1, random_state=0).iloc[0].to_json('example.json')
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
with open('ml-model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
 ```

This is a very simple example of how to train a model and make it portable through the Pickle package object serialization. Whatever you go &mdash; for cloud or other computers &mdash;, if you have the same scikit-learn and Python version, you will load this Pickle file and get the same object of when it was saved.

Notice that in the `boston_problem.py` I put a command that prints the columns of my dataset. It's important because the order of columns matter in almost every algorithm of ML. I used the output of this command in my Flask application to eliminate possible mistakes.

## Flask application

If you don't know anything about Flask, I recommend you to read the Todd Birchard articles [[2]](#L2).

The `app` folder contains two files: `ml-model.pkl`, the object that contains my exact created and trained model; and`ml-app.py`, the application itself.

In `ml-app.py` I read the `.pkl` using the Pickle package:

```python
with open('ml-model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    MODEL = pickle.load(f)
```

After that, I created a variable that I named `app` and it's a Flask object. This object has a [decorator](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/decorators-python) called `route` that exposes my functions to the web framework in a given URL pattern, e.g., _myapp.com:8080_**/** and _myapp.com:8080_**/predict** has `"/"` and `"/predict"` as routes, respectively. This decorator gives the option to choose the request method of this route. There are two main methods that can be simply described as follows:

- GET: to retrieve an information (message);
- POST: to receive an information and return the task result (another information/message);

I created one function for each method. The first is a message to know that the application is alive:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def server_check():
    return "I'M ALIVE!"
```

And the second is my model prediction function:

```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predictor():
    content = request.json
    # <...>
```

Remember that I said that for almost every algorithm the column order is important? I made a `try`/`except` to guarantee that:

```python
    try:
        features = pd.DataFrame([content])
        features = features[FEATURES_MASK]
    except:
        logging.exception("The JSON file was broke.")
        return jsonify(status='error', predict=-1)
```

The last two command lines of the `ml-app.py` file runs the application into the IP `0.0.0.0` (localhost).

```python
if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run( debug=True, host='0.0.0.0' )
```

The conditional statement `__name__=='__main__'` is because I just want to run my application if I am executing the file `ml-app.py`. 

## Dockerfile

If you don't know what is Docker or Dockerfile, I recommend you to read these articles, Docker documentation [[3]](#L3) and  my last project article section Docker & Dockerfile [[4]](#L4).

This is the Dockerfile of this project:

```dockerfile
# a small operating system
FROM python:3.6-slim-buster
# layers to install dependencies (less prone to changes)
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
COPY app/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# layers to copy all files (more prone to changes)
COPY . /main
# change to the application directory to execute `gunicorn`
WORKDIR /main/app
# starts application with 5 workers
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", ":8080", "--workers", "5", "ml-app:app"]
```

I choose a small operating system to build images faster and put the less prone to changes layers in the beginning. In the `requirements.txt` have the necessary packages and its respective versions to execute my application.

`gunicorn` is a lightweight WSGI HTTP server that is commonly used in production deployments. It has the capability to do some kind of load balancing creating replicas of the application's process in the container OS. This is very useful in scenarios where we have lots of simultaneous requests or when our application may fail. In the last scenario, `gunicorn`will kill and replace the failed process.

The `--bind` argument is to set the container address of the application, in this case, in the localhost in port 8080. The `--workers` is to set the number of replicas of the application's process. A recommended number of workers is `2*cores + 1`. I choose 5 workers because I'll use nodes will 2 vCPUs in my cluster. The `ml-app:app` means that the object of our application is in `ml-app.py` and its name is `app`.

## Kubernetes

What is a Pod?

What is Kubernetes?

What is a Deployment?

## Deploying an application in Kubernetes

Deploy an application in Kubernetes is very simple. You only need some YAML configuration file templates. In this project I brought you two of them. A file to the deployment itself and another to the service that will expose the application. If you need to deploy you own model, you will need just to change some names, labels and container information sections. This two files are in folder `k8s`. Take a look over there.

**IMPORTANT:** *In Kubernetes, when you expose an application service, all the world can access it. This isn't secure and you'll need a API gateway to expose it. I'll use Google Cloud Endpoints to do that. If you don't know the benefits of an API gateway, check this simple Red Hat article [[5]](#L5).*

### A simple Kubernetes deployment (unsecure)

Kubernetes has lots of objects, take a look at [this table](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types), it's huge. However, in this project I'll need only two of them: Deployment and Service objects. 

First, let's go with the Deployment object described in `k8s/deployment.yaml`. To explain all the sections of this YAML configuration file, I'll break it in pieces.

#### Piece 1: The Deployment object definition

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ml-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: ml-api
```

- `apiVersion`: Which version of the Kubernetes API you'll use. If you research, you can find that Kubernetes has beta version features/objects and other extensions. You don't need to understand this deeply.
- `kind`: What kind of object you want to create. In this case, a Deployment.
- `metadata.name`: Whatever you want. The name of the Deployment.
- `metadata.namespace`: Namespaces are some kind of workspaces. You can use it to organize your Kubernetes objects. I'll use the `default` for simplicity.
- `metadata.labels`: Whatever you want. Just choose a key and a value. Labels are another kind of organization and it can be used to filter objects in your cluster. The key `app` that I created will be used find some objects in process of deployment.

#### Piece 2: The Deployment object specification

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2
  minReadySeconds: 5
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
```

- `replicas`: Number of pods running the deployment of the containers images that will be described below. Scale as you want.
- `minReadySeconds`: Waiting time after the deployment of a new pod is ready to use. I'll describe below how do we know it is ready.
- `strategy`: This configuration is to set the behavior in case of a re-deployment.
- `strategy.type`: Setting this as RollingUpdate will make your re-deployment smooth. If you want to understand more about rolling updates, please go to Keilan Jackson article [[6]](#L6).
- `strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge`: The number of pods that can be created above the defined number in `replicas`.  Can be integer or percentage (rounded down).
- `strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable`: The number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process in comparison with `replicas`. Can be integer or percentage (rounded up).

Note: Do not set `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` both zero.

#### Piece 3: The selector

```yaml
spec:
  # <... replicas, minReadySeconds, strategy ...>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ml-api
```

- `selector.matchLabels`: It's like a filter that will assign every pod that are labeled with specifics key-value pairs to this deployment. In this case, the label are `app` and the value are `ml-api`.

#### Piece 4: The template

```yaml
spec:
  # <... replicas, minReadySeconds, strategy, selector ...>
  template:
    metadata:
      name: ml-pod
      labels:
        app: ml-api
    spec:
      containers:
      	- name: ml-container
      	  image: gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/gkecicd:COMMIT_SHA
      	  ports:
      	  	- containerPort: 8080
```

- `template`: This will be the template of the specification for deploying pods when needed, e.g., when a pod must be killed and replaced.
- `template.metadata.name`: Whatever you want. The prefix name of the Pod.
- `template.metadata.labels`: This needs to match the Selector filter in Piece 3.
- `template.spec`: Pod specifications.
- `template.spec.containers`: List of the pods' container images.
- `template.spec.containers.name`: Whatever you want.
- `template.spec.containers.image`: Container image registry in Google Container Registry
- `template.spec.containers.ports.containerPort`: Every pod has an IP. The `containerPort` will expose the defined port of the IP to the Kubernetes cluster. In the Dockerfile was defined the port 8080, so it must be here too.

```
This is enough to have an application that can be called through the Kubernetes cluster ...

## Continuous Integration

In my previous project in GitHub, I described how to set a Google Cloud Build trigger to a GitHub repository. Please go to [Git Repo](https://github.com/jgvaraujo/ml-deployment-on-gcloud#git-repo) section in this project to see how to do it [[4]](#L4).

## Kubernetes

Now, we create our Kubernetes cluster in GKE using this simple command:

```bash
# define main values
_CLUSTER=ml-cluster        # name
_N_NODES=1                 # size
_ZONE=southamerica-east1-b # zonal cluster
_MACHINE_TYPE=n1-highmem-2 # 2 vCPUs and 13GB vRAM

# create a cluster with this specifications
gcloud container clusters create $_CLUSTER \
    --num-nodes $_N_NODES \
    --machine-type $_MACHINE_TYPE \
    --zone $_ZONE
```

To check if everything is up you can use the command `kubectl get all`. To be more specific, I like to use `kubectl get nodes,pods,svc`.
